                        Waste management (or waste disposal) includes the processes and actions required to manage waste from its inception to its final disposal. This includes the collection, transport, treatment and disposal of waste, together with monitoring and regulation of the waste management process and waste-related laws, technologies, economic mechanisms. Waste can be solid, liquid, or gaseous and each type has different methods of disposal and management. Waste management deals with all types of waste, including industrial, biological, household, municipal, organic, biomedical, radioactive wastes. In some cases, waste can pose a threat to human health.Health issues are associated throughout the entire process of waste management. Health issues can also arise indirectly or directly.
                        <br><br>
                        1. Avoid Plastics <br><br>
                        It can be difficult to manage plastic waste as it is not recyclable. This is one of the primary reasons why you should avoid plastic bags. Carry your own shopping bag when you go to the grocery shop. Do not use plastic containers to store kitchen items either. Use glass for storage. It is healthier for your family and for the environment.
                        <br><br>
                        2. Buy Food That Has Minimal Packaging <br><br>
                        Shop at the ‘bulk buy’ section of the grocery store. Rice, pulses, and other essentials can be bought without plastic packaging. Food that comes in multi-layered packaging can increase the waste in your house. Pick products that do not include so much packing. For example- you don’t need the box of the toothpaste. So, pick a paste that comes without the carton. It will help you dispose of home waste effectively.

                        3. Compost Your Kitchen Waste <br><br>
                        An eco-friendly waste management method is to compost your organic waste. Invest in a good composting bin and make rich compost from your kitchen waste. This will reduce your organic waste and leave you with quality manure for your gardens.
                        <br><br>
                        4. Perform Transactions Electronically So That You Can Minimise Use of Paper <br><br>
                        Transact electronically. Ask for a soft copy of bills on your email address rather than a hard copy. Remind merchants not to print your copy of POS transactions while shopping. Transfer money through NEFT or RTGS to avoid printing chequebooks. This will cut down the amount of recyclable paper waste in your house and teach your child a little about the importance of household waste management. <br><br>
                        5. Consider Making Soaps and Detergents in Your Own Home <br><br>
                        Almost all detergents and cleaning liquids come in plastic packaging that cannot be recycled. The internet is full of assistance if you want to make your washing soaps, detergents, and bathroom cleaners at home. You will reduce plastic waste by doing this, and you will end up with chemical free, home-made detergents.
                        <br><br>
                        6. Repurpose Sturdy Containers and Recycle other Materials <br><br>
                        Most glass and tin containers can be reused to store some other item that it was originally intended for. You can also reuse paper bags as bin liners to throw garbage. Use both sides of paper for printing or use the clean side to make your lists or have your baby do some colouring. This will help you curb the solid waste accumulation in your house. <br> <br>
                        7. Dispose of Hazardous Waste in a Responsible Manner <br><br>
                        Managing bio waste needs care and caution. It is unwise to dump material like batteries, medical syringes, unused medicine in a careless manner. The chemicals leech into the soil and can become toxic for people living in that area. Plants absorb these toxins too, and we consume vegetables that are laden with chemical waste from the soil.

                        The key takeaway for better waste management is to recycle glass, metal, clothing, and certain plastics. Leftover food should be composted else it decays in the soil and produces methane gas which is toxic to life. Be thrifty and use old rags for wiping, washing etc., and avoid buying overly packaged food. If every household made a conscientious effort to manage household waste, we could put an end to the piling garbage at our street corners, and in our oceans, and water bodies. So make an effort to manage your household waste for a greener tomorrow!
